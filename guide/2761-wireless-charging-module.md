## Wiring
Due to this guide being only an example of how to use the product, we will be mostly using alligator clip wires to connect the components together. In this guide, we will be using the [Super Current Wireless Charging Module (5V 2A)](https://www.canadarobotix.com/products/2761) and [Digital Multimeter (DT9205A)](https://www.canadarobotix.com/products/2800) that are both from our store.

## Wiring Guide

**Step 1:** First of all, let's connect a power source to the alligator clips.

**Step 2:** Let's test out the voltage that will be given into the wireless charging module by using a multimeter. Set the Multimeter to 20V to measure the voltage in between 0V-20V.

Looks like the voltage given is around 12.5V, which is perfect for our wireless charger which operates at around 9V-12V.

**Step 3:** Connect the **Transmiter Module** to the alligator clips.

**Step 5:** Now you can connect the power to the **Transmitter Module** and hover the **Receiver Module** over it. There should be a **red light** to confirm when the **Receiver Module** is receiving power.

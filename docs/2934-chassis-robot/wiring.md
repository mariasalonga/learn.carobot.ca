# How to Wire Chassis Robots with Arduino

## Materials:
* [Soldering station](https://www.canadarobotix.com/products/1557) (OPTIONAL)
* [Wire stripers](https://www.canadarobotix.com/products/1892)


## Stripping the Wires
1. Start off by stripping an inch of the wires for both ends 
2. You may trim the battery pack wire shorter to remove the unnecessary length 
3. Stripping off an inch of the battery pack wires as well
4. Once all the wires are stripped fold one end of exposed wire in half and twist together
> **The thicker end of the wire will be the side you connect onto the motor sheild**

## Wiring the Motor
****This step is recommended to do BEFORE attaching the motor to the structure of the robot****
1. Position the motor so that the axle of the motor is towards the right and the loops to connect the wires is facing you
2. Next feed through the red wire in the bottom loop and twist untill secure
3. Then repeat the step for the black wire on the top loop
4. Once you have twisted on all the wires to their respected motors you now have the option to permanently secure the wire to the motor

## Wiring the Motor Shield
1. The motor shield is labeled M1 to M4
2. Screw in the red wire to the left side
3. Screw in the black wire to the right side
4. Screw in the red wire of the battery holder to the side labeled '+'
5. Screw in the black wire of the battery holder to the side labeled '-'

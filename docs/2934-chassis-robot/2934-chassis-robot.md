title: Chassis Robot Kit
---

The Chassis itself cannot do much on its own. Adding an Arduino allows us to give the Chassis a brain, to learn and perform commands. Pairing the Arduino with a motor sheild gives us the ability to better communicate with the motors and the Arduino. In this tutorial you will learn how to assemble, wire, and program a basic Chassis robot to function as a programmable robot.

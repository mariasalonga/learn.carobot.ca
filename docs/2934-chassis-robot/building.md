# How to Build Chassis Robot with Arduino

## Materials:
* [Simple Robot Chassis Kit](https://www.canadarobotix.com/products/2798) 
* Screw driver 


## Attaching the Motors to the Base
1. Screw on the support rods in the middle, top, and bottom of the left and right side of the board

> ****check out the wiring section to see how to connect the wires to the motors****
2. Flip the structure over so the rods are facing down
3. Push through the 't' shaped piece in the provided slot
4. Snap on the corresponding black gears to the inner side of the motor axle 
5. Line up the holes of the motor to another 't' shaped piece and insert the long screw in the loacted holes

> **Repeat steps 3-5 for the rest of the motors**
 

## Attching the Top Base and Wheels
7. Snap in the wheels to the outer side of the motor

## Attaching the Arduino Board 
1. Connect the Motor shield to the Arduino board 
2. Use the provided double sided sticky tape to secure the board onto the robot
3. Apply the double sided sticky tape to the back of the battery pack as well to secure that into place
